# Text Classification

In this session, we will try to identify, visualize, and exploit patterns in features extracted from text: Which texts are more similar? Which are different? Can we use these features to classify texts into categories?

In this session, we will dig deeper into the extracted features and use dimensionality reduction techniques to visualize emerging patterns. Using the State of the Union dataset, we will practice what we have learned by trying to automatically guess if a speech was delivered by a Democratic or a Republican president.

While not strictly required, attending the previous sessions in the series and “Intro to Machine Learning with scikit-learn” is highly recommended.


Materials are currently in preparation.
