# Text Classification

Text classification is the process of categorizing text documents into pre-defined groups using machine learning methods.

## Session description
In this session, we will try to identify, visualize, and exploit patterns in features extracted from text: Which texts are more similar? Which are different? Can we use these features to classify texts into categories?

In this session, we will dig deeper into the extracted features and use dimensionality reduction techniques to visualize emerging patterns. Using the State of the Union dataset, we will practice what we have learned by trying to automatically guess if a speech was delivered by a Democratic or a Republican president.

## Getting started

### Requirements
While not strictly required, attending the [previous sessions in the series](https://git.dartmouth.edu/lib-digital-strategies/RDS/workshops/text-analysis/text-analysis-with-python) and [Intro to Machine Learning with scikit-learn](https://git.dartmouth.edu/lib-digital-strategies/RDS/workshops/machine-learning/intro-to-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn) is highly recommended.

### Install
The material is provided as Jupyter notebooks. To run them, you need some kind of Jupyter server. Some options are:
- A [local Jupyter installation](https://jupyter.org/install)
- [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- The [Dartmouth JupyterHub](https://jhub.dartmouth.edu/) (Dartmouth-only)

### Usage
The repo contains two notebooks:
- `text-classification.ipynb`
  - This notebook is intended to be used in a code-along session. It contains instructions and background info, as well as fully functional code.
- `add-meta.ipynb`
  - Code that is not directly relevant to the goals of the session is outsourced to this notebook to keep the main notebook as focused as possible.
